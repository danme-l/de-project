# Repository for my Project for the DataTalks Data Engineering Zoomcamp

DataTalks ran a free [Data Engineering Course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and this repository contains my final project.

The goal of the project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline, using some or all of the following technologies:
* Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure or others
* Infrastructure as code (IaC): Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, ...
* Workflow orchestration: Airflow, Prefect, Luigi, ...
* Data Wareshouse: BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, ...
* Batch processing: Spark, Flink, AWS Batch, ...
* Stream processing: Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis, ...

The dataset I'm going to use the [trip data from Montreal's Bixi Bike system](https://bixi.com/en/open-data), a network of on-demand bicycles that I used when I was living in my beloved Montreal.
