### Airflow
Automated Workflow Orchestration. Airflow allows us to configure workflows as code, using python scripts (essentially configuring files for the workflow) known as DAGs (directed acyclic graphs). There is a very handy webserver with a UI to visualize pipelines, view logs, monitor progress, etc.
